## egrabber-python

Controlling cameras with a Euresys framegrabber in Python requires the **egrabber** package. This is available for both Windows and Linux.

The official Python SDK is not published on PyPI but comes bundled with the eGrabber SDK as a wheel file. This is available on the Euresys [website](https://documentation.euresys.com/Products/COAXLINK/COAXLINK/en-us/Content/04_eGrabber/programmers-guide/Python.htm).

It is provided here for convenience purposes and installing via git.
